# DevTracker – Your Personal Learning Progress Tracker

## 🧠 What it does
DevTracker helps you track your learning goals, like “Learn React”, “Build a project”, “Finish a course”, etc. It’s a simple progress manager — add goals, check in with progress updates, and mark them as completed.

## 💡 Why tech students will use it
We follow YouTube courses, bootcamps, docs — and often forget where we left off.

This app lets you track what you're learning, how far you've come, and keeps you motivated.

Works offline, fast, mobile — perfect for reviewing goals on the go.

## 🔧 Core Features
- **Add Learning Goals** – Example: “Finish React course”

- **Mark as Done** – Mark a goal complete and reflect back later

## 📲 5 Simple Screens
